    <h2>Ingredients for the dough</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 1/2 cups warm water</li>
            <li>11/2 cups warm water (about 110 degrees F)</li>
            <li>1 (1/4-ounce) packages active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
            <li>3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup semolina flour</li>
            <li>1/2 cup vegetable oil, plus 2 teaspoons to grease bowl</li>
            <li>teaspoon salt    </li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps for the dough</h2>  
        <ol>
            <li>In a large bowl, combine the water (1 Â½ cups), yeast, and sugar(1 tsp) and stir to combine. Let sit until the mixture is foamy, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add 1 1/2 cups of the flour, the semolina, 1/2 cup of the oil, and the salt, mixing by hand until it is all incorporated and the mixture is smooth. Continue adding the flour, 1/4 cup at a time(8 times), working the dough after each addition, until all the flour is incorporated but the dough is still slightly sticky.</li>
            <li>Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth but still slightly tacky, 3 to 5 minutes. Oil a large mixing bowl with the remaining 2 teaspoons oil.</li>
            <li>Place the dough in the bowl and turn to oil all sides. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and set in a warm, draft-free place until nearly doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.</li>
        </ol>
